# scan
scan uses state-of-the-art object detection algorithms for the recognition of different tick species belonging to the Hyalomma genus. 
Ticks of this  genus are amongst the most frequent ectoparasites of livestock in the NENA region, they transmit several pathogens of veterinary and zoonotic importance. 
scan has been applied up to date to the recognition of two important Hyalomma species in Tunisia, Hyalomma dromedarii which has been recently shown to carry the Crimeanâ€“Congo hemorrhagic fever virus in Southern Tunisia, and H. scupense which is the vector of T. annulata the agent of tropical theileriosis an important disease of cattle in the NENA region.
scan may help better mitigate tick threats through early detection of population dynamic shifts, having therefore the potential to be applied as a tick surveillance tool.
